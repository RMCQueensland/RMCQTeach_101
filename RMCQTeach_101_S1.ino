/*  This sketch is designed to teach Arduino basics. It incorporates      - An Arduino device (in my case Pro Mini),      - A breadboard, some jumper wires,      - A sensor (momentary button),      - An LED,      - A feedback switch (micro switch),      - Some resistors (470R), and      - A servo.        This is the full program in its end state. During the class, the components are built up to show the differing     aspects as the components are added to the circuit and the program written.        Stage 1 - Light an LED using the blink program    - Add the LED to the positive rail of the breadboard,    - Add a resistor from the other LED lead to the output Arduino pin D10,    - Write S1 code to make the LED blink, upload and test.*/    //Setup constants here//S1#define LEDpin 10     //Defines the pin the LED is attached tovoid setup() {  //S1  pinMode(LEDpin, OUTPUT);  //Setup the pin connected to the LED as an output  }void loop() {  //S1  digitalWrite(LEDpin, LOW);  //Turn the LED on  delay(1000);  //Tell the program to wait for 1s  digitalWrite(LEDpin, HIGH); //Turn the LED off  delay(1000);  //Tell the program to wait for 1s}
